/*HERE IS SOME NOTES I TOOK WHILE DOING THE PROJCET
 * 
 * when you call a method which use an object which created inside of a main method
 * first thing first to create that method you need to pass that object as a parmeter of the method
 * 
 * so after we play we shall let player two to play too, for that since is 
 * only me and I so Imma let the computer be the player two... 
 * we just gonna do randomazitaion but it wont play on our played cells 
 * 
 * now everything works well but I have to make sure the computer 
 * code keeps asking for the input nad I also have to  decide when 
 * to stop placing pieces for that is when someone win or a if there is a draw
 * in shor Imma use while loop for that ...
