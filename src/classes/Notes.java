					/*YOU CAN NOT HAVE A STATIC METHOD INSIDE INNER CLASSES*/

							  /*Type 1: Nested Inner Class */
/*It can access any private instance variable of the outer class. Like any other instance variable,
 *  we can have access modifier private, protected, public, and default modifier.
 *  Like class, an interface can also be nested and can have access specifiers.*/


							/*Type 2: Method Local Inner Classes */
/*Inner class can be declared within a method of an outer class which we will
 be illustrating in the below example where Inner is an inner class in outerMethod().*/

								/*Type 3: Static Nested Classes*/
/*Static nested classes are not technically inner classes. They are like a static member of outer class. */
