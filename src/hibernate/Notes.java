/* ORM
 * Object Relation Mapping
 * 
 * When we are using database sometimes we use tables and stuff
 * but we cant use it efficenly becuase there must be a mapping too which allow us to make a relation
 * between object in the java class and the fields in the database relation side so we can access every
 * field efficiencly and that is why we need an ORM and the best tool for now to use with ORM is HIBERNATE
