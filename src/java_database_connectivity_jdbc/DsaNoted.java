 * DATA STRUCTURE is the way of organizing data.
 * ALGORITHM is the set of steps a program take to finish a task.
 * ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHM deals in find the best algorithm to use which runs fast and takes less memory.
 * TIME COMPLEXITY mda unaochukua program kufanya kazi fulani.
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY nafani ya memory inayochukua program kufanya kazi fulani.
 * ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS helps in evaluating the performance of algorithm in terms of input and size encreasin.
 * ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION is the mathematical tools used to describe ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS.
 * Three types of ASYMPTOTIC NOTATIONS is a) OMEGA b) BIG O c) THETA
 * OMEGA NOTATION gives us the least amount of time that the program can take.
 * BIG O NOTATION gives us the highes amount of time that the program can take.
 * THETA NOTATION gives us both the least and highes amount of time that the program and also the avarage time.
 * 
 * BIG O NOTATION RULES
 * + Drop the lower order terms.
 * + Drotp the constant multipliers.
 * 
 * LINEAR ALGORITHM TIME COMPLEXITY  is 0(n).
 * POLYNOMIAL ALGORITHM TIME COMPLEXITY is 0(nSquare).
 * + Most of the times when there is nested for loop.
 * + The more nested for loops the more order we get.
 * 
 * SINGLY LINKED LIST is a structure used for storing collection of nodes
 * + its nodes every each has data and reference of the next data 
 * + the last node has data and all null reference
