/*This expression is used while we are dealing with functional interface
* A functional interface is an interface which has only one abstract method inside it, and we use lambda expression
* for that particular abstract method, ir reduce more lines of codes and makes the coding easier
*
* Note: abstract method won't have a body but can have parameters
*       lambda operators can be, 0 parameter, 1 parameter or 2 parameter.
