/* WHY DELETING ECLIPSE ON DESKTOP ALSO DELECTES THE REAL ECLIPSE
 * --> Because you saved it as you eclipse installation path next time change the installation
 * path when you install eclipse
 */

/* WHERE CAN I GET MY ECLIPSE PROJECTS AFTER I DELETE ECLIPSE
 * --> Github
 */

/* WHAT TO DO, I CANT FIND THE SERVER TAG IN ECLIPSE 
 * Help -> Install New Software
 * Choose "Luna - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/luna" site
 * Expand "Web, XML, and Java EE Development"
 * Check JST Server Adapters and JST Server Adapters Extentions
 */

/* WHY ECLIPSE WONT SHOW THE VERSION OF THE TOMCAT I INSTALLED
 * help-->update new softwares
 * then update those folders 
 * restart eclipse and boom
 */

/* WHAT TO DO, MY TOMCAT WONT WORK
 * --> read the error and if the error says fail to start
 * delete the tomcat on ther server tab
 * and also delete tomcat runtime and reset up tomcat again
 *--> if the error says tomcat is being used 
 * jsut change the tomcat port number by double clicking the tomcat in the server tab
 * there you will see the port numbe and change it  
 */

/* MY PROJECT GIVE ERRORS AFTER I DELETED TOMCAT
 * click the project and build a path
 * there go add a new library 
 * choose server and add tomcat
 * that is all you gotta do
 */

/* WHY GITHUB WONT COUNT MY CONTRIBUTIONS
 * because you didnt connect you github user name and email to eclipse 
 * to do that search for git configuration 
 * there go add add entry 
 * for the key type user.name 
 * and value must be your github username
 * appl and save and add another entry there
 * for the key must user.email
 * and value must be your github user email
 * apply and save
